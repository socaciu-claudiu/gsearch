Index and search for everything on your database for PUG 2022

Nowadays it is very common to have a global search on an application that will give user relevant data. However, searching for data on multiple tables just by a keyword in a large OpenEdge database can be quite intensive and time consuming. 
One way to solve this challenge is by using “blazing-fast, open-source enterprise search platform” Apache Solr™ to index and global search your Openedge data.
So why does it?
The answer has to do with performance. A user must be able to do a global search and retrieve data as fast as possible to be able to support the business in a proper way.
First, we’ll be looking into how we will be indexing the data using” Apache Solr™” once the data is created/changed/deleted in the OpenEdge database
Second, we will see how we can query the” Apache Solr™” indexed data to retrieve the relevant data for our searches. 
In this presentation I would like to share with you a proof of concept that can demonstrate this.
